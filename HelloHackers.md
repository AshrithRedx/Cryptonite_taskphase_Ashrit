Hello Hackers module in Linux Luminarium describes the basics of using Linux command line with basic knowledge about how the dojo works, the user accesing the shell and indication of admin or otherwise.

## Intro to Commands
 The simple 'whoami' command in the shell indicates who the user accessing the shell is (i.e the hacker) and case-sensitivity of the commands.

 ## Intro to Arguments
 This question indicates how arguments are passed into the command line with the simple demonstration of the 'echo' command.
 The 'echo' command usually works as a print function, simply printing out to standard output.
